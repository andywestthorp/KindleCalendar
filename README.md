# KindleCalendar
Show your iCal on your old kindle

Acknowledgements

This is based on the work of Pablo Jim√©nez Mateo  https://github.com/pablojimenezmateo/kindle-wallpaper which is based on the work of Matthew Petroff: http://www.mpetroff.net/archives/2012/09/14/kindle-weather-display/

It also used code from Matt Healy https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle-heroku/tree/main

This version combines the above to make a simple screen display showing weather and calendar events but it also creates a file called events.txt which can be viewed to show four weeks worth of upcoming calendar events.

Feel free to copy and use as you wish.
